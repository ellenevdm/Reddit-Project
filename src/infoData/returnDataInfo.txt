It is the biggest house in the family so we often host family gatherings.\r  \n\r  \nMy husband\u2019s youngest sister Jane (31f) has been traveling for work ever since her early 20\u2019s. Mid 2022 she moved in with her fianc\u00e9 about half a hour drive away from us. After that Jane shows up regularly at family gatherings and rebuilds relationships with her family members. The only thing she never bothers to do is address my daughters by their names.\r  \n\r  \nAmy and Nina are identical twins. I understand when people refer to them as \u201cthe twins\u201d but I think it is important that their individuality is respected. I always tell family and friends that now that they are 6 years old it is important for them to have their own identity and if possible please treat them as individual rather than a pair or a unit. My girls have different interests and hair/dressing styles so it is not hard to tell them apart.\r  \n\r  \nJane always insists on calling the girls \u201cthe twins\u201d and makes no effort to distinguish them. I asked her many times to treat them as individuals, like her other nieces and nephews, and Jane would say OK and then keep doing the same thing.\r  \n\r  \nLast Christmas Amy made paper cranes and Nina painted flower pictures as their Christmas gifts to everyone in the family. They signed their names and individually handed the gift to everyone. Jane\u2019s fianc\u00e9 had to work this year and did not join us so after brunch she video called him in the living room while the rest of us did our things nearby. Her fianc\u00e9 saw the crane in her hand and asked where she got it and Jane said \u201cOh, one of the twins gave it to me for Christmas. The other twin drew some flowers.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nI felt that this was a disrespect as my girls put a lot of effort into the gifts and deserve to have their private dedication recognized. When everyone left, I told Jane I expected her to call my girls Amy and Nina from now on and to treat them like individual and know their differences. Jane said that she won\u2019t bother as my girls are too young. So I told her she is banned from my house until she learns how to address my girls by their names. Jane just stomped off. My husband agreed with me on this.\r  \n\r  \nA few days ago my MIL called to plan my husband\u2019s birthday in early February. I told her we could have the party at my house like usual but Jane would not be invited. My MIL was alarmed and asked why and when she learned of what happened she was mad at Jane. Jane called me a few hours ago calling me AH for making a big deal out of something insignificant. She said my girls would be known as the twins whether I like it or not and once they get older people WILL recognize them as individuals but not now when they\u2019re young and \u201cjust another couple of girls.\u201d She said she deserves to be with her family for her brother\u2019s birthday and I need to let it go.

Lately, our son has been coming home from school and continuously asking why he looks more like his other mommy but looks nothing like me. This was a conversation my wife avoided having for a long time but he kept asking. I decided to explain to him that he looks like his other mommy and not me because he was in her tummy and has half of her genetics, and that's why he looks more like mommy than me. He seemed okay with that. My wife noticed that he no longer noticed he was asking and asked me why he wasn't asking this question anymore. I told her that I explained he was in Mommy's tummy and shares half of her genetics. \n\nShe was pissed with me and got into a massive argument, saying I shouldn't have told him that. Personally, I can't see what I did wrong as I explained what he wanted to know; he was okay with that; I told him, although you weren't in my tummy, I love you just as much, if not a little more, than other mommy does. \n\nAITA?",

Lately, our son has been coming home from school and continuously asking why he looks more like his other mommy but looks nothing like me. This was a conversation my wife avoided having for a long time but he kept asking. I decided to explain to him that he looks like his other mommy and not me because he was in her tummy and has half of her genetics, and that\u0026#39;s why he looks more like mommy than me. He seemed okay with that. My wife noticed that he no longer noticed he was asking and asked me why he wasn\u0026#39;t asking this question anymore.

My family is a complete clusterfuck, I was raised by my grandma, and I've been supporting everybody financially since college. \n\nWill's parents, \"Mary\" and \"John,\" have always been nice to me. At the engagement party, Mary pulled me aside and informed me, \"You don't have to worry, our family will cover the wedding.\"\n\nAt the time, this sort of rubbed me the wrong way for a few reasons (the presumption of it all, the idea that we wanted a wedding, etc.). Although Mary is very, very sweet to me and clearly excited to have me become part of their family (which I'm thankful for), she can be overbearing sometimes. \n\nEven though I honestly didn't want a wedding, after talking it through with Will, I agreed to have the big wedding that both of his sisters had. \n\n**Where it all blew up / I'm probably the asshole:** \n\nFor the first time in our relationship, we spent the holidays with my grandmother. To make it up to his parents, we celebrated \"fake Christmas\" during the MLK weekend with Mary and John. \n\nDuring the weekend, Mary scheduled us for a session with the wedding planner. During the entire wedding process, I've basically allowed Mary to do most of the work. She has tried to include me but clearly enjoys the process, so I've let her have at it. During the session, it came out that they've budgeted $300k for the wedding. \n\nWhen I found this out, I freaked. I kept my composure w/ the wedding planner but let loose in the car home on Mary. \n\nAlthough I was polite, I made it clear that I was uncomfortable with spending that much money and made several judgments about how the money could be better spent. I told Mary that she could not understand how most people live, including my own family, and brought up several religious arguments about how the money should be spent on charity (we are both Christian). \n\nMary was very offended by this; she argued that her family donates to charity, that the wedding costs will fund the community, and that I am in no place to judge as we are both living better than most ppl in the world and I own luxury items. \n\nI honestly didn't think that the argument was that big of a deal until we returned home from the weekend last night. Will told me that his entire family was angry with me for insulting his mother, that they think I'm \"biting the hand that feeds me,\" and I owe his mother an apology. \n\nDuring this argument, he yelled at me for the first time in our relationship.

I (M34) had no idea he was trans or even questioning his gender, he always seemed perfectly happy as a girl, y'know he was very feminine presenting and all. Turns out he came out to our parents after getting his hair cut and they didn't take it well in the slightest.\n\nFrom what he's told me, he wasn't exactly kicked out, they just started being unbearable. They were calling him 'Myla' in every sentence they said (just to annoy him i suppose), mum kept booking him in for appointments to get hair extensions and his lashes done, our da didn't let him wear the male uniform to sixth form and so on.\n\nIt got so bad that he literally took a train from down south to up the north to ask if he could live with me. Of course, I said yes. The house is big enough to have him live there, there's four bedrooms and an attic room.\n\nMy girlfriend (Nico, 32) was irritated when she found out. We've discussed her moving in before Will came and now she's telling me that she will not move in until Will leaves. I've explained to her that Will isn't a child we'd have to constantly supervise, that if anything he's the one making the place more liveable (he's very insistent on adding on to the home decor and so on, as well as being better than me at cleaning.), and that the house is large enough to still have privacy even with him around.\n\nNico's argued that it's not truly 'ours' if Will is always there, that we won't be able to start trying to concieve, that she's not willing to live with a 'hormonal and rebellious' teenager and that she's just flat out uncomfortable with Will being near her and living with her and her son (M10) in the same home.\n\nUltimately, I've told her that my loyalties lie with my baby brother, who is homeless and vulnerable, unlike the grown woman with a good paying job and a home of her own. She's called my mum up to complain about it and she's said that i was in the wrong for prioritizing Will, and Will himself said that he doesn't want to be 'causing problems' in my relationship.",

There's a lot of background here that I need to get out of the way first.\n\nElla's father is my brother Tom and Ella's mom died due to complications delivering my other niece Becca (8f). Ella was 7 at the time and she blamed Becca for their mom's death. She quickly became very angry and expressed hatred for her sister and made comments about how Becca should have been the one to die instead or that Becca stole her mom from her. Tom did not get Ella any help. I got involved and warned him Ella was not coping well and things would turn nasty. Tom said he was helping the girls relationship and that's all that would be needed. Then two years later, with no therapy and no improvement in the relationship between the girls, Tom married Sarah. This is where things went from bad to worse. Becca adored Sarah and started calling her mom almost immediately. This only angered Ella more. She would get so angry at her dad, at her sister, at her stepmom and she would tell Becca she deserved to die and how dare she replace the woman who died because of her. She told Tom he was sick for doing that to her mom. She told Sarah she was stealing from her mom and she hated her and her ugly face and she would never be good enough. These are things that happened out in the open and were witnessed by our whole extended family but they also went on at home.\n\nSarah did her best to try and get Ella help but Tom was not on board and Sarah was not the right person to do it. CPS became involved after Ella called them on Sarah and wanted to get Becca and Sarah separated at all costs. She wanted to punish her sister for calling Becca mom and wanted to punish Becca too. It became clear after CPS got involved that while Sarah was not a danger to Becca, Ella and Becca could not continue to live together in the environment they were in. I think they only took things so seriously because Ella told the social worker after wishing Becca and Sarah dead and telling them how much she hates her sister.\n\nMy husband and I stepped up and offered to take Ella which CPS agreed to. When I spoke to them about the rules and how things would be handled. They said not to set up visits with Tom or Becca for Ella and to get Ella therapy. But they did say, if we wanted to, we could attend larger family functions even if they would be there. But it would likely be better not to. I already knew this. My husband and I discussed it and we agreed we should all stay away while Ella is with us and is still struggling as much as she is.\n\nI told my family what we had decided and they did not understand why we couldn't have quick visits or make the effort to expose the girls to each other in shorts bursts. I said I felt it would be bad for both of them but mostly for Ella, who I had to prioritize as she needed so much help. My family then claimed my big announcement was like a fuck you to them. Tom was enraged. AITA?",

No matter how much it was a pain to do I always made sure she had options to eat when I hosted or she was over. She is vegetarian and at one point tried to go vegan.\n\nMy son and her never hosted due to living in a small apartment but that changed since they have just bought a home. They are having a dinner this week and I called her to remind her I am allergic to nuts. She then informed me that she doesn\u2019t doenst have time and to bring my own food. She told me that she cooks a lot with different nuts and she can\u2019t make adjustments to her menu.\n\nThis is where I am at be a jerk, I told her I will not be going and neither will my husband. That I have accommodated her for years and not once have I made her bring her own food. This started an argument where she thinks I am being unreasonable.\n\nMy husband is on my side but my son and her as very upset.\n\nEdit: stop downvoting people who say there are allergies that are not life threatening, they are correct. My allergy is not life threatening, if it was going to kill me I wouldn\u2019t be okay with any of the dishes having nuts, I just asked for one that I can eat. I can be at a table with nuts it\u2019s fine.\n\nThis actually personally annoys me, allergic reactions are a spectrum from very mild to kill you. \n\nAlso for everyone saying allergies get worse every time people have it are incorrect, some allergies can be improved through exposure therapy which is usually done at a doctors. My daughter has literally done that with her shellfish allergy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I have always made extra dishes that didn\u2019t include meat to accommodate her. No matter how much it was a pain to do I always made sure she had options to eat when I hosted or she was over. She is vegetarian and at one point tried to go vegan.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMy son and her never hosted due to living in a small apartment but that changed since they have just bought a home. They are having a dinner this week and I called her to remind her I am allergic to nuts. She then informed me that she doesn\u2019t doenst have time and to bring my own food. She told me that she cooks a lot with different nuts and she can\u2019t make adjustments to her menu.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is where I am at be a jerk, I told her I will not be going and neither will my husband. That I have accommodated her for years and not once have I made her bring her own food. This started an argument where she thinks I am being unreasonable.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMy husband is on my side but my son and her as very upset.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEdit: stop downvoting people who say there are allergies that are not life threatening, they are correct. My allergy is not life threatening, if it was going to kill me I wouldn\u2019t be okay with any of the dishes having nuts, I just asked for one that I can eat. I can be at a table with nuts it\u2019s fine.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis actually personally annoys me, allergic reactions are a spectrum from very mild to kill you. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso for everyone saying allergies get worse every time people have it are incorrect, some allergies can be improved through exposure therapy which is usually done at a doctors. My daughter has literally done that with her shellfish allergy.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\u003C!-- SC_ON --\u003E",

She always secretly fancied him but never did anything about it bc of the gf.\n\nAlmost 2 years ago now, Liam got drunk at a party and made a pass at Gloria, who shut him down right away and dismissed it as him just being drunk.\n\nOver the following year, more incidents like that would happen, and they started chatting privately via message, then she would feel guilty about it, shut it down and then on the next opportunity, he would message again.\nPretty much every time they saw each other and the gf wasn\u2019t around, he would somehow signal his interest for her. \n\nIt culminated in them sharing a kiss one time after a party almost a year ago. Since then, he\u2019s told her he has feelings for her, which are reciprocated by her.\n\nSince then, they have been pretty having an emotional affair, whilst he is incapable of breaking up with his gf because he seems to avoid conflict and having hard conversations. He\u2019s been basically breadcrumbing Gloria, saying that he wants to breakup with his gf but doesn\u2019t know how to. So it always feels like he is very close to becoming single but then it doesn\u2019t happen.\n\nThis has been going on for 9 months now, and they talk and meet up some times but nothing physical has happened since that  first and only kiss.\n\nIn turn, Gloria has been depressed, unable to date anyone else, waiting for Liam to break up with his gf for her.\nShe also says she feels extremely guilty because she knows his gf, etc.\n\nHowever, when I suggest to her to just break things completely off with him, at least until he is single, she says she wants to but can bring herself to do it.\n\nSo I said she doesn\u2019t feel as guilty as she claims to feel, bc if she did, that would prompt her to break things off. Now she is mad at me.\n\nAITA?",

She always secretly fancied him but never did anything about it bc of the gf.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAlmost 2 years ago now, Liam got drunk at a party and made a pass at Gloria, who shut him down right away and dismissed it as him just being drunk.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOver the following year, more incidents like that would happen, and they started chatting privately via message, then she would feel guilty about it, shut it down and then on the next opportunity, he would message again.\nPretty much every time they saw each other and the gf wasn\u2019t around, he would somehow signal his interest for her. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt culminated in them sharing a kiss one time after a party almost a year ago. Since then, he\u2019s told her he has feelings for her, which are reciprocated by her.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESince then, they have been pretty having an emotional affair, whilst he is incapable of breaking up with his gf because he seems to avoid conflict and having hard conversations. He\u2019s been basically breadcrumbing Gloria, saying that he wants to breakup with his gf but doesn\u2019t know how to. So it always feels like he is very close to becoming single but then it doesn\u2019t happen.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis has been going on for 9 months now, and they talk and meet up some times but nothing physical has happened since that  first and only kiss.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn turn, Gloria has been depressed, unable to date anyone else, waiting for Liam to break up with his gf for her.\nShe also says she feels extremely guilty because she knows his gf, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHowever, when I suggest to her to just break things completely off with him, at least until he is single, she says she wants to but can bring herself to do it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESo I said she doesn\u2019t feel as guilty as she claims to feel, bc if she did, that would prompt her to break things off. Now she is mad at me.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAITA?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\u003C!-- SC_ON --\u003E",

At home when it's just me and my husband, I don't cover up to pump. When I have company over, I wear a cover over the pumps (nothing wrong with not wearing a cover... I'm just personally not comfortable pumping with my nipples exposed in front of my in-laws, parents, friends, etc). FYI without a cover, even though you are fully clothed, the nipples are visible through the flanges when you pump.\n\nYesterday my front lawn camera triggered a notification, and I saw the delivery guy walking up to my house with a package that I was expecting. I was mid-pump so I texted my husband, but he replied that he was in the middle of a work meeting and could not come to the door. After ringing the doorbell and receiving no answer, I could see on security cam that he was writing the missed delivery slip for pickup at the post office.\n\nHonestly, it's such a pain because you have to wait until the next day and drive all the way to the post office. So I decided - screw it - threw on my cover and opened the front door. He looked very shocked and very uncomfortable to see me: I had my pump clipped to my waist, a cover over the flanges, so while no breast or nipples were exposed, you could tell there was the outline of something attached to my chest, some tubing visible, and obvious pump noises and possibly audible milk spray. ~~It looked something like~~ [~~this~~](https://diyababycare.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/poncho-breast-pumping-cover-pbpc002-3.png). **Edit:** I just pumped again, so this time [I took a picture with the exact cover I was wearing](https://imgur.com/a/bjzevWP) (so no nips/breasts exposed, but definitely obvious that I was pumping).\n\nHe basically cleared his throat, shifted and looked away while I signed for the delivery. Then as he handed me the package, he kind of winced and said: \"You know you didn't have to open the door in your... state. It's nothing urgent.\" I replied: \"Yeah, but I don't want to make a trip to the post office to pick it up when you're already here.\" He seemed quite annoyed and said: \"I think you should realize that this makes others uncomfortable.\" At that point, I felt quite annoyed and said rather sarcastically, \"My bad for traumatizing you. Hope no one else on your delivery route answers the door with medical equipment.\"\n\nWhen I told my husband, he rolled his eyes and said \"that guy needs to get over himself.\" But thinking about it, I wonder if I was being an inconsiderate AH. Perhaps this is different from breastfeeding or pumping in public? There, you are minding your own business and others can look away, and you are not \"making\" them look at you. By answering the door, I was maybe forcing him to interact with me while I was in a state that some might find uncomfortable? I wonder if I've misunderstood some kind of social contract here.\n\nEdit: title misspelling, breast \\*PUMP not bump!",

I on the other hand, as a brother, was a little concerned because of course I don't want my sister to be hurt or harmed. \n\nYesterday was our dad's birthday, and my sister invited Jake to visit us for the first time. We have a family tradition that when it's Dad's birthday, everyone over 15 has to make sure to drink the cherry tincture that Dad made himself. It's not strong at all and even the kids don't get drunk on it. But when Mom poured it for Jake, he started to say he didn't drink it. Mom said that it wasn't strong at all, and that it was delicious, and that he could take just one sip if he didn't want to drink the whole glass, but Jake kept saying that he never drank. Not even a sip of anything alcoholic. \n\nThen I said he was only a guest in our home and should honor our traditions. Jake blushed and said he wasn't allowed any alcohol for medical reasons. I said that one sip would do nothing and that he was disrespecting our dad. My sister was embarrassed and asked Jake to take a sip. Dad was embarrassed too and said it was okay and he wouldn't be offended if Jake didn't drink the tincture \n\nFinally, Jake gave in and took a tiny sip of the tincture. Spoiler: he spent the whole evening with us after that and nothing bad happened to him. \n\nAfter he left for his place, a small argument started in our house. My dad thought I acted like a selfish child, my mom didn't see anything wrong with what I did, neither did I. My sister looks like she hasn't decided which side to take yet.",

My adoptive mom and dad raised me until I became an adult and moved out at 18.\n\nI started dating my husband soon after and we got married when I was 20. About a month we found out we were pregnant. Everyone was elated and in my eyes both my adoptive parents and bio dad and step mom were equally my child's grandparents.\n\nFast forward to when I was 9 months pregnant and could pop any day. My extended family has a family reunion every year and one member asked on our family Facebook page who all was coming. Since I was due a week after the reunion was to take place I said I wasn't coming. My adoptive mom so said she wasn't going because she \"was waiting for her grand child to arrive\".\n\nEverything was fine and dandy until my adoptive mom and I found out that our extended family was talking about our situation and said that my adoptive mom shouldn't be excited to see my child because my kid was not her grand kid biologically. In response, my mom wrote a post about how family is family no matter how were related and if we love each other that's all that matters. One of the extended family members said that my adoptive mom treats my sister and I seperate from her own biological children (the only reason why we're treated different is each of us have our own special needs. For example, I have anxiety, depression and ptsd. One sibling is autistic, another has bpd. We all have different needs). I told this person \"tell us honestly how you see any of us raised unfairly compared to any other SIBLING. You sound stupid sitting there repeating yourself so if you feel that you get to have a say in the first place then defend it, otherwise shut up\"\n\nThis offended her (insert eye roll here) and she messaged me literally an hour after I had given birth telling me I need to respect my elders and what I said was rude. I believe that respect goes both ways and what I said was mild compared to what I wanted to say. Also this entire conversation could've waited until I was at least out of the hospital.

So what my father did was ask my mom to be his girlfriend, and then six hours later asked Jenna to be his girlfriend too. Yes, in the same day. He admitted it. Jenna knew he was cheating on my mom with her but she didn't care. Mom didn't know about Jenna. The next day he asked Tricia to be his girlfriend. I didn't mention her in my previous post since I didn't find out about her until recently. Tricia didn't know anything and no one knew about Tricia. Not mom, not Jenna. No one. \n\nSo, yeah. Three girlfriends at the same time.\n\nThen he married mom and had me. He also had a son with Jenna, with me and my mom being unaware of it for a very long time. Ended up leaving us for Jenna. Broke my mom's heart. I was only 13 at the time.\n\nYesterday he came over saying Jenna and Tricia found out about each other and both of them left him, with Jenna moving out and filing for divorce. Now he wants me and mom to take him back. He asked me to 'put in a good word with mom.' Told me mom would give it a try if I asked, after mom already turned him down.\n\nI told him what I said in the title. Later on, my grandma called me and said I should at least try to hold back a little and show a little respect, since he did raise me being leaving and that I owe him at least the bare minimum courtesy.",

A girl (5 years old), twin boys (4 years old) and another boy (3 years old). She's currently pregnant with their fifth kid. \n\nShe got a degree from college, but she completely ditched her career when she got pregnant with their first baby. My brother took over the family business, so I guess they're well enough financially.\n\nEver since she had her first child, she got into this \"annoying mother mindset\" in which she literally can't talk about anything else than her kids and how much she loves motherhood. She's always giving advice to anyone who is listening, always asking dumb questions that she already knows by now, just to keep the focus on her and her kids. \n\nI have two kids myself, so I was always understanding and tried to help her especially with her first child, since I already was a mom at the time. But ever since the twins she's turning more annoying every time we meet. \n\nShe can go on and on for hours about her kids, her marriage, her house, basically just bragging about how perfect her life is. She seems to believe that she's in some sort of fairytale or something, she comes across as childish sometimes. \n\nWell, I got tired of it. She was in the middle of bragging about how easy it was for her to get pregnant again when I asked if she knew how insensitive she was sounding. She said that she just feels fortunate for her fertility. I let it go that time, but then she started talking about how much she enjoys motherhood and how she feels this was her call, she said that it's so easy and she can't imagine prioritising a career instead of her children.\n\nWell, I snapped at that. I told her that she should stop bragging about her perfect life like that, without a care if the other women near her have fertility issues or financial problems that don't allow them to just sit at home all day looking after the kids. She got defensive and said I'm just jealous because my marriage is a failure, so I can't be happy for her.\n\nI told her that she sounded like an entitled child (along with some other things) and she started crying. Now I'm the asshole because I can't be happy for my own niblings and their mother? I am seriously struggling to see how I'm wrong here, that's why I am asking here\n\nETA; should've made this more clear, but she thinks that women who prioritise a career instead of her children are bad mothers. For an example she thinks that my marriage is failing because I work instead of staying home and focusing entirely on my children/ my husband. \n\nI'm going to add this here because way too many people are asking me to explain it: She believes that once a woman has children, her life should be devoted to her children and her husband because that's what she did. So if a woman (for whatever reason) chooses to go back to work after having children, then that automatically makes you a bad mother. \n\nIn fact, our kids like to play together, we often have playdates for our kids. But when her kids come to my house she has to come as well since she doesn't trust that I'll take good care of her children. This is not only applied to me, but she has refused to send her oldest daughter to other kid's houses because their mothers have jobs. \n\nBasically, she thinks that to be a good mother and have a good marriage, you have to do what she did, if you don't do it like her then it's your fault if your marriage fails and you're a bad mom.\n\nAlso, I am in the middle of divorcing my husband. She thinks it's because I don't stay home and I wasn't paying enough attention to my husband, but I'm divorcing my husband because he is a man child who doesn't do chores and even expected me to tie his shoes! My marriage is in fact failing (has failed, actually) but not because of the reasons that she claims. \n\nAnother edit... I DON'T doubt that she is happy with her life, she does seem too content. I say this because some people seem to be thinking that she's lying and she's actually miserable, well from my perspective I don't think she feels that at all. I don't doubt that her life is perfect for her, but when she goes on and on about it and makes those dismissive comments about other mothers, that's annoying. Just thought that I'd give my insight on that since I saw a few comments about it. ",

My mom F32 barged in and slammed the door open yelling at me and my sister F12 to go clean the dining room and kitchen. Which was a reck because I F15 have two younger siblings aside my sister F12 who are sick. The table was a reck after I had just cleaned it like yesterday they left food ,wrappers, cups ,water, juices ,toys, clothes etc in the dining room. Id like to say one of them isnt really sick she just cant go back till 24 hours without a fever my mom F32 rarely makes them clean up. She makes me F15 and my sister F12 clean up after them and calls it our mess and picks out very fee things me and F12 leave which is normally just dishes in the sink most of the time. As i F15 and my sister F12 try not to go out of our rooms because our mom F32 and dad are very difficult. No one really has chores aside me F15 and my sister F12. But back to the story shes yelling at us its like 7:10 about how shes told us to clean up and its not been clean and its not hard to pick up after ourselves. My mom F32 after her yelling fit and slamming things then slams her door and goes in her room. Me and my sister continue to clean up and clean it up which i finished off because my sister goes to public school and has to catch the bus. I get mentos that are my mom\u2019s and i go knock and tell her she owes money to the jar. For context she made a jar like two years ago and had this whole speech how she yells a lot and wants to do better and made these changes in the house. Which she does often and never follows through with. But the jar basically is you put money in it if you yell or say bad words. She then went on a rant saying she doesn\u2019t need to put money in and then shifted the blame on me and my sister.saying we make her yell and that she repeats and we make her yell and that we don\u2019t clean up . And thats why she yells and saying im behind in work and we\u2019re the reason she yells and screams. So we need to put money in the jar to and that my sister left a bowl on the table and she had to tell her to put it in the sink. So we owe money to the jar to if she owes money . i figured this would happen because when i said we were the ones who did the most chores and no one else really had chores. she screamed at me that we dont and were lazy and dont even do the chores we have .and that she has to do everything around the house and that the younger two cant pick up after them selves .and told me to shut up and stop talking and that she didn\u2019t want to hear it which she does often all this is while screaming at me mind you. Then when i said to my grandma that she shifts the blame to any one else and never takes accountability for what she does. It always is no your wrong and shut up and stop talking and that she doesnt wanna hear it and she doesn\u2019t take accountably i was told thats disrespectful. tbh this isnt even all of it if i continued with things she does id be writing a whole book.",

My partner and I talked a lot about pros and cons of having kids and we both agreed I wouldn't abort if I ended up pregnant but we won't actively work on kids. \n\nHowever in the last year we wanted kids more and more. First we wanted to foster (adoption is nearly impossible in our country) but then we sorta ended up pregnant. I am due to give birth soon and my friends are being dicks about it. I told them off and called them cruel and they called me a selfish asshole.\n\nSo, context, since I have been purposefully child free most of my life I am aware of the downsides of having kids. I personally think a lot of people are being unwise when they decide to have kids and less population is generally better but I never ever said it to someone's face especially when they were expecting. One cannot know what are peoples motives to have children or to not have children and I never judged. Whether you have offsprings or not is completely irrelevant to me to see you as a person. \nWhen I got pregnant I was delighted but scared, naturally. I am anxious person by nature and I always talked through my things with my friends who were always there for me. Until the topic centered around my pregnancy. For the past 7 months of pregnancy, every time I mentioned something bad relating to pregnancy (like having nausea, back pain, insomnia) my friends jokingly said \"well you got yourself into that shit, now suffer hahhaa\". First it was a joke but sometimes it gets really hard and considering we always whine about something (one of the friends the other day literally cried cuz she missed a beginning of a movie in cinema, and nobody said anything to her) I don't think me \"whining\" about discomfort of carrying a baby is too much. \n\nLately, they even upped the game saying stuff like they won't come by our place when the baby is there (I mean where should I put the baby???) and saying stuff like \"nice knowing you\", \"ah now you won't be able to go to concert with us\" (even tho when the concert happens baby will be 7 months old and I have tickets and plan to go).\n\nOne went so far to tell me they don't even wanna met my baby, and that's when I lost it and called them all cruel. This resulted in backlash, calling me selfish asshole because I decided to have kids and I shouldn't be imposing the kid on them.\n\nThing is....I am not imposing anything. The kid will simply be there and I never ever mentioned anything about them babysitting or looking after or in any way shape or form being included in baby's life. Just think I am going through something life changing (whether it was my decision or not) and just don't want them to dump shit on me whenever I mention anything related to my pregnancy or baby. \nI dunno, they all made some bad decisions in their lives, we all did, and we all were there for each other and this feels like I am their personal landfill because of their own issues with natalism/antinatalism.\n\nOpinions?",

First we wanted to foster (adoption is nearly impossible in our country) but then we sorta ended up pregnant. I am due to give birth soon and my friends are being dicks about it. I told them off and called them cruel and they called me a selfish asshole.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, context, since I have been purposefully child free most of my life I am aware of the downsides of having kids. I personally think a lot of people are being unwise when they decide to have kids and less population is generally better but I never ever said it to someone\u0026#39;s face especially when they were expecting. One cannot know what are peoples motives to have children or to not have children and I never judged. Whether you have offsprings or not is completely irrelevant to me to see you as a person. \nWhen I got pregnant I was delighted but scared, naturally. I am anxious person by nature and I always talked through my things with my friends who were always there for me. Until the topic centered around my pregnancy. For the past 7 months of pregnancy, every time I mentioned something bad relating to pregnancy (like having nausea, back pain, insomnia) my friends jokingly said \u0026quot;well you got yourself into that shit, now suffer hahhaa\u0026quot;. First it was a joke but sometimes it gets really hard and considering we always whine about something (one of the friends the other day literally cried cuz she missed a beginning of a movie in cinema, and nobody said anything to her) I don\u0026#39;t think me \u0026quot;whining\u0026quot; about discomfort of carrying a baby is too much. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELately, they even upped the game saying stuff like they won\u0026#39;t come by our place when the baby is there (I mean where should I put the baby???) and saying stuff like \u0026quot;nice knowing you\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;ah now you won\u0026#39;t be able to go to concert with us\u0026quot; (even tho when the concert happens baby will be 7 months old and I have tickets and plan to go).\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOne went so far to tell me they don\u0026#39;t even wanna met my baby, and that\u0026#39;s when I lost it and called them all cruel. This resulted in backlash, calling me selfish asshole because I decided to have kids and I shouldn\u0026#39;t be imposing the kid on them.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThing is....I am not imposing anything. The kid will simply be there and I never ever mentioned anything about them babysitting or looking after or in any way shape or form being included in baby\u0026#39;s life. Just think I am going through something life changing (whether it was my decision or not) and just don\u0026#39;t want them to dump shit on me whenever I mention anything related to my pregnancy or baby. \nI dunno, they all made some bad decisions in their lives, we all did, and we all were there for each other and this feels like I am their personal landfill because of their own issues with natalism/antinatalism.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOpinions?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\u003C!-- SC_ON --\u003E",

Me and BIL have Ruby 50/50, but I am still in college and can\u2019t have someone staying with me in student accommodation, so this will only be in effect after I graduate.

There was a time, when Callie was 8, that Myra got into a relationship with a man called Troy. They were together for 3 years and the three spent a lot of time together. Myra introduced Troy almost immediately and they worked on all of them bonding and getting to know each other. Then after 3 years Troy and Myra had been talking marriage. Troy decided to ask Callie for her blessing. Callie said she didn't want her mom to marry him. At that point he decided the relationship as a whole was not going to work and he told Myra and they broke up. \n\nMyra never forgave Callie for refusing to give her blessing and she blames her for the downfall of the relationship with Troy. He didn't want to be stuck in a relationship where Callie would never want him around and Myra was convinced that Callie had lied for many years and has said Callie always said how much she loved Troy. I know that was more wishful thinking on Myra's part and Callie never said anything either positive or negative. She was never asked and never offered it independently. \n\nCallie knows how Myra feels about her and when she moved out 18 months ago, she did so with being fully independent from her mom so she wouldn't have to be around her mom's resentment. I have spoken to my sister about this and she denies resenting Callie.\n\nMyra cannot understand why Callie stays away. She has complained about this a lot and has asked me what she's supposed to do and why \"this shit\" has to be so hard and when I ask her what she means she says parenting. I told her a few days ago that if she really wants to know what her next step should be, I told her it's therapy. I told her she badly needs it because she refuses to see why her relationship with Callie is so distant today.\n\nMyra took offense to the suggestion and told me I shouldn't be treating her like she's crazy.\n\nAITA?",
